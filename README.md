# WeatherPi

## Background
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. This projectuses Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?

## Task

This project focuses on performing API calls and retrieve weather information on over 500 random cities. 
After retrieving the data I made scatter plots to show the effect that latitude has in relationship to temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed.
